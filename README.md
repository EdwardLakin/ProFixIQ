📁 Folder Structure (High-Level)

=============================================================

## Self-learning fitment dataset (backend only)

ProFixIQ maintains a backend-only “fitment evidence” dataset that grows automatically as the shop uses the system.

**Goal:** The system gets smarter over time by learning which parts are actually used on which vehicle configurations.

---

### Core tables

#### `public.vehicle_signatures`
- Per-shop vehicle signatures anchored by **(shop_id, vehicle_id)**.
- Stores normalized vehicle configuration captured from `vehicles`:
  - make, model, year
  - trim / submodel
  - engine, drivetrain, transmission, fuel_type
- Acts as the **source of truth** for vehicle_year / vehicle_trim used in fitment events.
- Can later be re-keyed to a full configuration hash if needed.

#### `public.part_fitment_events`
- Append-only log of real-world evidence:
  > “Part X was used on vehicle signature Y”
- Automatically populated by DB triggers.
- Enforces idempotency via **UNIQUE(allocation_id)**.
- Stores:
  - vehicle_year, vehicle_trim
  - snapshotted part metadata (brand, part_number, supplier)
  - confidence_source / confidence_score
  - event_type (allocation vs confirmed consumption)

---

### Automatic logging flow

When a `work_order_part_allocations` row is inserted:
1. Resolve work order + vehicle context (`shop_id`, `work_order_id`, `vehicle_id`)
2. Get or create the per-shop `vehicle_signature`
3. Insert a `part_fitment_event` with:
   - year / trim from the signature
   - default `confidence_source = 'manual'`
   - default `confidence_score = 1`
   - `event_type = 'allocated'`
   - `ON CONFLICT (allocation_id) DO NOTHING`

When a stock move is recorded with `stock_move_reason = 'consume'`:
- A **confirmed consumption** fitment event is recorded for the same part + vehicle signature.

---

### Derived data

#### `public.fitment_stats` (materialized view)
- Pre-aggregated stats per:
  - shop_id
  - vehicle_signature_id
  - part_id
- Includes:
  - allocation count
  - confirmed consumption count
  - first_seen_at / last_seen_at
- Used for fast fitment-aware queries and AI ranking.

---

### Future capabilities enabled

- Fitment-aware part suggestions
- Higher-accuracy AI quoting
- Shop-specific learned parts matching
- Confidence-weighted recommendations
- Optional global aggregation (opt-in, anonymized)

> No UI depends on this yet. This system is intentionally backend-only until enough data exists.
## Property Operations Rollout – Step 19A

- Added internal-only attachment placeholder metadata wiring on `/property/requests/[id]`.
- Placeholders now create `property_request_attachments` rows with metadata only (no file upload).
- No Supabase Storage upload flow, no storage bucket creation, and no service-role usage in this step.
- Tenant/vendor auth wiring is still intentionally deferred.
